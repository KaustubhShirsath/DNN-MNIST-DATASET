## Handwritten Digit Classification

•Classified 60000 handwritten digit images from MNIST dataset using neural 3 layer MLP network using pytorch
•Optimized the algorithm by Convolutional Neural Network with Lenet-5 model architecture in pytorch framework.
•Improved the model accuracy from 99.75% on MLP network to 99.02% on CNN(Lenet-5) .
•Used Negative log likelihood loss function and Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer in MLP network and Cross
Entropy Loss function and Adam Optimizer in the CNN(Lenet-5) for training the dataset.
